# Python project classification

The goal of this project is to extend [project2vec](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/10/06/find-and-compare-python-libraries-project2vec) by proposing new approaches to classify Python packages by using new data sources for package descriptions (GitHub, PyPI, StackOverflow...) and by fiding new learning models to link packages metadata to their topics or classifiers.

Contributions and improvements suggestions are welcome.
